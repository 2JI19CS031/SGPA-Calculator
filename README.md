# SGPA-Calculator
This project is developed by me with "Basic C programming language." This calculator is just for 3rd sem(2018 scheme) students studying in BE course under VTU Belgaum.
This calculator calculates SGPA's of two students at a time and compare their SGPA's with previous students SGPA's and gives the Rank list. 
It also store the students merit list in "Rank_List.txt" file in system
